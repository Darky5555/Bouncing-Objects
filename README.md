# Bouncing-Objects

In this assignment, you will build a simulation where turtles move inside a bounded area. When turtles hit the boundary, they will “bounce” off the walls. You will implement two different movement systems:

1. Angle-based movement (heading system)
2. Coordinate-based movement (delta x / delta y system)

You will then extend the first system so that new turtles are created every time a wall is hit, creating a growing simulation.




## Starter Requirements

Your program should include:
- A screen setup (black background recommended)
- A playing_area() function that draws the boundary box
- A list to store all turtles in the simulation

## Part 1: Playing Area
```python
playing_area()
```

Create a function that draws a square boundary:
- Size: approximately 480x480
- Centered on the screen
- Use a visible color (teal or similar)
- The boundary should be filled or outlined clearly

## Part 2: Movement Using Heading (Angle-Based)
```python
move_with_heading(t, turtles)
```

Write a function that:
- Moves the turtle forward continuously
- Uses:
    - forward()
    - setheading()
    - heading()

Behavior Requirements:
- The turtle should bounce off walls using reflection
- Use angle reflection logic (like a mirror bounce


Extension Requirement (IMPORTANT)
When a turtle hits any wall:
- Create a new turtle
- Give it:
    - Random color
    - A shape
    - Random starting direction
    - Speed of 0
    - Add it to a list of turtles
    - Return the updated list

## Movement Using Delta X / Delta Y
```python
move_with_deltas(t, dx, dy)
```

Write a function that moves a turtle using:
- dx (change in x position)
- dy (change in y position)

Behavior Requirements:
- Update position using:
    - x = x + dx
    - y = y + dy
- Use: 
    - t.goto(newX, newY)

Wall Collision Rules:

- If hitting left or right wall:
    - Reverse dx
- If hitting top or bottom wall:
    - Reverse dy
Return Values:
-   Return updated (dx, dy)

## Main Simulation Loop

Your program should:

- Store turtles in a list:
    ```python
    turtles = [yertle]]
    ```

- Continuously update all turtles:
    - Loop through each turtle
    - Call move_with_heading()
- When new turtles are created:
    - Add them to the list
    - They should immediately begin moving too

## Expected Behavior
After completion:

- One turtle starts moving
- It bounces inside the box
- Every time it hits a wall:
    - A new turtle appears
- Over time:
    -  The screen fills with many moving turtles
